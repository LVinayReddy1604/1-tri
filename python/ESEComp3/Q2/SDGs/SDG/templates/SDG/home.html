  <h1>Sustainable Development Goal 4 (SDG-4)</h1>

  <p>SDG-4 is about ensuring inclusive and equitable quality education and promoting lifelong learning opportunities for all.</p>

  <p>Education is the key to unlocking human potential and driving sustainable development. It empowers people to lead healthy, productive lives and contribute to their communities. Education also helps to reduce poverty, inequality, and conflict.</p>

  <p>However, millions of children around the world are still denied access to quality education. This is due to a number of factors, including poverty, gender discrimination, and conflict.</p>

  <p>The world is committed to achieving SDG-4 by 2030. This means ensuring that all children, regardless of their background, have access to free, quality primary and secondary education. It also means ensuring that all adults have access to lifelong learning opportunities.</p>

  <h2>Challenges</h2>

  <ul>
    <li>The lack of qualified teachers</li>
    <li>The need for more investment in education</li>
    <li>The need to address gender inequality in education</li>
    <li>The need to make education more relevant to the needs of the 21st century</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Progress</h2>

  <p>Despite the challenges, there has been significant progress in recent years towards achieving SDG-4. For example, the global primary school enrollment rate has increased from 65% in 1990 to 91% in 2015. However, there is still more work to be done to ensure that all children have access to quality education.</p>

  <h2>What can be done?</h2>

  <ul>
    <li>Increase investment in education</li>
    <li>Train more qualified teachers</li>
    <li>Make education more relevant to the needs of the 21st century</li>
    <li>Address gender inequality in education</li>
    <li>Ensure that all children have access to free, quality primary and secondary education</li>
    <li>Provide lifelong learning opportunities for all adults</li>
  </ul>

  <p>SDG-4 is essential for building a more sustainable and equitable world. By ensuring that everyone has access to quality education, we can create a better future for all.</p>
